# React Redux Blog
A blogging software built with [React](https://reactjs.org/), [Redux](https://redux.js.org/), and [DraftJS](https://draftjs.org/).

## Front End Only
This has no backend. You may plug it into any backend you want, including Firebase, and WordPress. 

### Rich Text Editing
DraftJS gives us a rich text editing experience. React gives us seamless flow.

## To Do

1. React-Router
  - put it in React-Redux to make React-Router-Redux
  - merge here for React-Router-Redux-Blog!

2. Menus
  - link Title
  - page order (drag n drop)
  - publish / unpublish

3. Components
  - drag n drop order
  - menu is a component, a specific one
  - artile is the generic one
  - reusable components like menu, header, footer
    - if you edit one, you edit them all

4. Page Templates
  - components pre-placed
